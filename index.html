        This certificate is awarded for ongoing credible service to any Society activity or program. This is intended to recognize and encourage the ongoing involvement of volunteers in Society programs. The initial certificate may be awarded after three years of continuous service. Service may be within a single role over multiple years, or reflect changes of roles within the Society. This is comparable to multiple Certificates of Appreciation signed at the presidential level.

        Named after the Computer Society’s first executive director, this certificate is the highest service award in recognition for long and distinguished service to the IEEE Computer Society at a level of dedication and achievement rarely demonstrated. Often includes service in several capacities, and positions of significant Society responsibility, with contribution levels justifying multiple Meritorious Service Certificates or higher. Areas of contributions might include initiating a Society program or conference, continuing officership in the Computer Society, or long-term and active service on Society committees.

        The Meritorious Service Certificate is the second highest level service certificate. A certificate is given for meritorious service to an IEEE Computer Society-sponsored activity. Qualification is enhanced by the level and number of contributions, excellence, dedication, and tenure of service. Examples are: any significant role in one activity such as an editorship, committee or conference support of unusual and/or continuing nature, and service as a Computer Society officer, committee or conference general or program chair

        The Outstanding Contribution Certificate is the third highest level service certificate. Unlike the Distinguished Service and Meritorious Service Certificates, this certificate is given for a specific achievement of major value and significance to the IEEE Computer Society. The achievement should be a specific, concisely characterized accomplishment, as opposed to a collection of different efforts. Examples are: the successful launching of a major conference series, a specific publication, standards and model curricula. A group OC award may be given for a major contribution in which a number of volunteers each made significant contributions. Certificates bearing all names would be awarded.
